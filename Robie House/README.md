I’ve taken up a new hobby of creating architecture “models” in Adobe Illustrator and I took on the challenge of creating Frank Lloyd Wright's Robie House. In the interest of being open and showing what I think is the interesting project here are the source Illustrator files for the work.

The whole project started from my general interest in the work of Frank Lloyd Wright. In setting out I mostly referred to existing blueprints and elevations as well as reference photos. It’s a much more complex building than I was anticipating and the resources for this kind of modeling are scarce. At one point I was so desperate in finding out what exacting the 3rd floor balcony looks like I googled "Robie House Drone Footage".

There are a few parts on the second floor that I haven't fully wrapped my head around what is actually going on structurally in the home. The whole house is mind bending and I feel like I’m getting schooled (by a master of course). I've probably got to go back in and adjust the window framing on the second floor as I didn't account for some features I found in a photo afterwards.

This has been a very fun project.
