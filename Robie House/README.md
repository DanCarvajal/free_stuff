Recently I’ve taken up a new hobby of creating architecture “models” in Adobe Illustrator and I took on the challenge of creating Frank Lloyd Wright's Robie House.

The whole project started from my general interest in the work of Frank Lloyd Wright. Setting out I mostly referred to existing blueprints and elevations as well as reference photos. It’s a much more complex building than I was anticipating and the resources for this kind of modeling are scarce. At one point I was so desperate in finding out what exactly the 3rd floor balcony looks like that I googled "Robie House Drone Footage". There are so many different layers of complexity in this house it's mindbending. I can't tell you how many times I would come across a photo that reveled I had been doing something entirely wrong.

This has been a very fun project but it's still a work in progress. In the interest of being open and showing what I think is the interesting project I've uploaded all the source files on [Github](https://github.com/DanCarvajal/open_protfolio/tree/master/Robie%20House).
