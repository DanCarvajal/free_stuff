A repository of free design and code things that I have made and think someone might want or at least find interesting. They are released under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License, which is maybe important I guess. I'd like attribution if possible but I understand instances where a good looking attribution isn't possible. Shout outs on twitter work well too, I'm at []@dan_v_c](https://twitter.com/dan_v_c).
